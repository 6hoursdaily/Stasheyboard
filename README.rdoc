== Welcome to Stasheyboard

This here is a rendition of Stashboard using Rails, Zurb Foundation, HAML, and Devise.

Remember to change the config.time_zone option in application.rb to suit your location.Run rake time:zones:all to see the available options.  For the Eastern US you add:

    config.time_zone = 'Eastern Time (US & Canada)'
    config.active_record.default_timezone = :local

A deployment can be visited at {stasheyboard.herokuapp.com}[http://stasheyboard.herokuapp.com]

=== To be done!
